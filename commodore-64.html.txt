<p><strong>The Commodore 64</strong>, also known as the C64 or the CBM 64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.</p>

<p>Part of the <strong>Commodore 64's</strong> success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores. <strong>Commodore</strong> produced many of its parts in-house to control costs, including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the <strong>Commodore 64</strong> including development tools, office productivity applications, and video games.</p>
